# BinaryTreeTraversal

## What is a binary tree?

In binary tree datastructures each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Depth first order.

There are 3 types of depth first order:
- Pre Order
- In Order
- Post Order

### Pre Order

In Pre Order we:
1. Check if the current node is Empty
2. Display the data part of the root
3. Traverse the left subtree by recursion
4. Traverse the right subtree by recursion.

### In Order

In Pre Order we:
1. Check if the current node is Empty
2. Traverse the left subtree by recursion
3. Display the data part of the root
4. Traverse the right subtree by recursion.

### Pre Order

In Pre Order we:
1. Check if the current node is Empty
2. Traverse the left subtree by recursion
3. Traverse the right subtree by recursion.
4. Display the data part of the root
